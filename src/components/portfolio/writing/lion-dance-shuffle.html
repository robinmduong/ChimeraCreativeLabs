<p>CALGARY, Canada — Three Southern Chinese lions prance to the resounding beats of a drum during the introduction to what may be the most controversial lion dance video on the web.</p>
<p>Jing Wo Association’s lion dance performance begins like any other, but in the middle of the show, the music stops.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, the music resumes. While the tune is familiar to much of the audience, it is not what anyone expects to hear. Overhead, LMFAO’s “Party Rock Anthem” blares from the speakers.</p>

<h2>“Every Day I’m Shufflin’”: An Unconventional Dance</h2>
<p>As the performance progresses, the dancers’ movements look less like the powerful gong fu punches that inspired traditional Chinese lion dance choreography, and more like modern street dancing.</p>
<p>Desmond Lee, head coach of Jing Wo, has been a lion dancer for over 20 years. Lee states, “We are not out there to become famous and did not expect that YouTube video to […] [go] viral.  But if it causes people to talk [about lion dancing], it’s a good thing.”</p>
<p>And talk is exactly what people did. Jing Wo’s dance and its encore performance at a local mall quickly became two of the most viewed—and controversial—lion dance videos on the Internet</p>
  
<h2>Meaningless Motions</h2>
<p>The Southern Chinese lion dance is a complex combination of Chinese gong fu, acrobatics and dance, but as entertaining as the dance may be, it remains a highly symbolic and ritualized performance in much of Eastern and Southeastern Asia. Traditionally, the lion dance was performed to ward away evil spirits and to encourage the influx of prosperity into one’s business or home.</p>
<p>According to Coach Lee, several highly conventional lion dance teams have voiced their displeasure with Jing Wo’s unconventional dance, calling a reflection of the decreasing respect that today’s youth holds towards this ancient tradition.</p>
<p>Coach Lee states that he did not mean to offend the lion dance community. The “Party Rock Anthem” routine was a dance that his students made up for fun after a dance training session and he happened to like it.</p>
<p>Jing Wo performed the “Party Rock Anthem” routine for the public only after completing a traditional lion dance routine outdoors in -27 °C (-16.6 °F) weather. The traditional routine lasted only 15 minutes, but the dancers had been standing in the cold for more than an hour prior to the traditional routine. Lee states, “I decided to allow the students to perform [the “Party Rock Anthem” routine] to allow them to let loose […] after the grueling [traditional] performance.”</p>
<p>According to Lee, Jing Wo performed the “Party Rock Anthem” routine one more time at a local mall after its initial performance. Jing Wo has not performed it again since. Lee states that all of his students must receive his permission before they lion dance in public. </p>
  
<h2>The Cultural Revival</h2>
<p>Like Jing Wo Association, popular culture and modern entertainment are blamed for the degradation of traditional Southern Chinese lion dancing. In fact, Jing Wo’s “Party Rock Anthem” dance, pop culture, and modern entertainment reflect a revival of interest in the art of Chinese lion dancing among today’s youth.</p>
<p>In 2010, Riot Games, the creator of the increasingly popular RPG game “League of Legends” released a lion dance-themed character skin for its playable character, Kog’Maw.  In 2012, “America’s Got Talent” featured two performances by Lion Dance ME, a San Francisco-based lion dance troupe.</p>
<p>“Pop” culture has utilized the beauty of lion dancing in particularly creative—and profitable—ways. In 2014, the world’s leading soda “pop” company, Coca-Cola, designed a lion dance-themed soda box that could be reused as a children’s toy. The empty soda box can be flipped upside-down and worn over one’s head—just like a real lion dance mask.</p>
  
<h2>The Evolution of Lion Dance</h2>
<p>Tradition will always have a place in lion dancing. Jing Wo’s “Party Rock Anthem” dance routine makes people laugh precisely because the routine because of tradition—if the “Party Rock Anthem” routine wasn’t preceded by a traditional routine, then the element of surprise would be lost, thereby weakening the emotional impact of the “Party Rock Anthem” routine.</p>

<p>Coach Lee understands that the key to reviving young people’s interest in lion dancing is to make lion dancing interesting. Lee states, “I find a lot of […] negative comments come from performers who do not […] understand what we are trying to do […] I have never charged for training; [my] students learn for free […] All of my students perform because they want to.”</p>
